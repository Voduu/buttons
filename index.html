                <p><strong>About Buttons:<br></strong>
                    Buttons is a cat. He was first found wandering the
                    wilderness in 20XX with his younger brother. One day he
                    found some humans and took a liking to them. Unfortunately,
                    his brother was much more skeptical and did not approach
                    the creatures. Instead, he left the lands to Buttons and
                    went in search of his own country to rule over.<br><br>Over
                    time, Buttons came to be the overlord of these lands, in
                    which he would one day wage a great war with the other cats
                    of the nation. These wars earned him the battle scars he
                    now posseses, including his damaged ear. As a result of the
                    conflicts, other cats now fear Buttons and cower before
                    him, or bring him tribute in the form of gifts or meals.<br>
                    <br>Buttons now spends his time leisurely strolling
                    through the lands he worked tirelessly to protect along
                    with the cats whom he deems worthy of his presence.
